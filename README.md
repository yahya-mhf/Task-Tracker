# Task-Tracker 
A simple command-line interface application to help you manage your daily tasks. This project allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks directly from the terminal. Tasks are organized by their status: TODO, IN PROGRESS, and DONE. All task data is stored in a local file to ensure persistence across sessions.
